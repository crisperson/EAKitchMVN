EA Kitchener Code Challenge
==============

This is my solution to the EA Kitchener job interview coding challenge. The project uses *maven* as the build tool for the project. The project also includes dependencies for *JUnit* and *JaCoCo* for unit testing and code coverage. An output of *JaCoCo* for the code coverage can be found in /target/site/jacoco/index.html. I also hooked this up to a local Jenkins instance for automated build testing. I've attached a screenshot of the Jenkins dashboard: /jenkins.png. 

I also used the Apache Commons Lang3 library for building my hashcode and equals methods for the Card and PokerHand class. This is included in the maven POM.

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this code challenge. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Thank you,

Mike
